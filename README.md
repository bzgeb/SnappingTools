# Snapping Tools
A collection of useful snapping tools for Unity.

## Tools
### Snap To Ground Tool
The snap to ground tool is a custom editor tool (available next to the move, rotate and scale tools) that snaps the selected transforms to the ground. It raycasts downwards using the chosen LayerMask and moves the transform's pivot to the location of the raycast hit.
